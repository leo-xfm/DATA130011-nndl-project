## Project1: Self-Constructed Neural Networks
In this problem we will investigate handwritten digit classification. MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by “re-mixing” the samples from NIST’s original datasets. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image and is labeled with the correct digit(0-9) it represents. You need to implement one or more neural network to recognize the handwritten digit, and conduct experiment to test your model and conclude the ability of your model. After that, you may implement several modifications to your model and test whether the model acts better.
